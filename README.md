# Convex-Hull-Gift-Wrapping
A quick project made in Processing to supplement a game I was making at the time.

This was a project I made in Processing to test some advanced forms of collision detection. A simple rectangular box would not suffice for a trapezoidal shaped object, so I decided to look into more advanced techniques to detect collisions such as this. I decided to go with the gift wrapping technique over the divide and conquer for simplicity, and since I would not be using this class in any extremely intensive programs.
